President Barack Obama said Monday he was confident his plan to go around Congress and implement new gun control measures by executive action would withstand any legal challenge.

"These are not only recommendations that are well within my legal authority and the executive branch," Obama told reporters gathered in the Oval Office. "But they are also ones that the overwhelming majority of the American people, including gun owners, support and believe in."

With Attorney General Loretta Lynch by his side, the President said he planned to roll out the new restrictions, aimed at combating a wave of recent shootings, in the coming days. He will hold a town hall on the topic Thursday that will air on CNN and is expected to make it a focus next week during his final State of the Union address.
